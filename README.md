# POC
This Repo Is for Fun/experimenting stuff. Contains proof of concepts which I build for understanding the concepts

# phpchat
Built php based chat system where api's are called using ajax in frontend to load messages. Messages are posted by calling apis through ajax.

# attendance
Built a python file parser which parses file named attendance.csv file (attendance file which can be downloaded from teams and renamed it to attendance.csv) it takes the input as the end time of class in 12-hr format and the minimum duaration(in minutes) which the attendee must be attendingT The attendance.csv file must be in the same folder as the python file.The output would be the name of the attendees who had attended a minimum of the prescribed duration.
